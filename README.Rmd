`covdata` is a data package for R. It provides COVID-19 related data from the following sources: 

- National level case and mortality data from the [European Centers for Disease Control](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en).  
- State-level case and mortality data for the United States from the [COVID Tracking Project](https://covidtracking.com). 
- State-level and county-level case and mortality data for the United States from the [_New York Times_](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data).
- Data from the US Centers for Disease Control's [Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/index.html) (COVID-NET). See below for details about this network and the scope of its coverage.
- Data from [Apple](http://apple.com/covid19) on relative trends in mobility in cities and countries since mid-January of 2020, based on usage of their Maps application.
- Data from [Google](https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/data_documentation.html) on relative trends in mobility in regions and countries since mid-January of 2020, based on location and activity information.
- Data from the [CoronaNet Research Project](https://coronanet-project.org), providing event-based tracking of governmental policy responses to the corona virus. 

The data are provided as-is. More information about collection methods, scope, limits, and possible sources of error in the data can be found in the documentation provided by their respective sources. (Follow the links above.)

Data are current through `r format(Sys.Date(), "%A, %B %e, %Y")`.

## Installation

There are two ways to install the `covdata` package. 

### Install direct from GitHub

You can install the beta version of congress from [GitHub](https://github.com/kjhealy/congress) with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("kjhealy/covdata")
```

### Installation using `drat`

While using `install_github()` works just fine, it would be nicer to be able to just type `install.packages("covdata")` or `update.packages("covdata")` in the ordinary way. We can do this using Dirk Eddelbuettel's [drat](http://eddelbuettel.github.io/drat/DratForPackageUsers.html) package. Drat provides a convenient way to make R aware of package repositories other than CRAN.

First, install `drat`:

```{r drat, eval = FALSE}
if (!require("drat")) {
    install.packages("drat")
    library("drat")
}
```

Then use `drat` to tell R about the repository where `covdata` is hosted:

```{r drat-covdata}
drat::addRepo("kjhealy")
```

You can now install `covdata`:

```{r covdata-drat, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("covdata")
```

To ensure that the `covdata` repository is always available, you can add the following line to your `.Rprofile` or `.Rprofile.site` file:

```{r rprofile}
drat::addRepo("kjhealy")
```

With that in place you'll be able to do `install.packages("covdata")` or `update.packages("covdata")` and have everything work as you'd expect. 

Note that my drat repository only contains data packages that are not on CRAN, so you will never be in danger of grabbing the wrong version of any other package.

## Loading the Data

```{r load}
library(tidyverse) # Optional but strongly recommended
library(covdata)

covnat
```

```{r}
apple_mobility %>%
  filter(region == "New York City", transportation_type == "walking")
```

```{r}
covus %>% 
  filter(measure == "positive", 
         date == "2020-04-27", 
         state == "NJ")
```


To learn more about the different datasets available, consult the vignettes or, equivalently, the [the package website](https://kjhealy.github.io/covdata/articles/covdata.html). 

### Citing the `covdata` package

To cite the package use the following:

```{r citation}
citation("covdata")
```

Please be sure to also cite the specific data sources, as described in the documentation for each dataset.
