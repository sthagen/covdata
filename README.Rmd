`covdata` is a data package for R. It provides COVID-19 case data from four sources: 

- National level data from the [European Centers for Disease Control](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en).  
- State-level data for the United States from the [COVID Tracking Project](https://covidtracking.com). 
- State-level and county-level data for the United States from the [_New York Times_](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data).
- Data from the US Centers for Disease Control's [Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/index.html) (COVID-NET). See below for details about this network and the scope of its coverage.

The data are provided as-is. More information about collection methods, scope, limits, and possible sources of error in the data can be found in the documentation provided by their respective sources. (Follow the links above.)


Data are current through `r format(Sys.Date(), "%A, %B %e, %Y")`.

## Installation

There are two ways to install the `covdata` package. 

### Install direct from GitHub

You can install the beta version of congress from [GitHub](https://github.com/kjhealy/congress) with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("kjhealy/covdata")
```

### Installation using `drat`

While using `install_github()` works just fine, it would be nicer to be able to just type `install.packages("covdata")` or `update.packages("covdata")` in the ordinary way. We can do this using Dirk Eddelbuettel's [drat](http://eddelbuettel.github.io/drat/DratForPackageUsers.html) package. Drat provides a convenient way to make R aware of package repositories other than CRAN.

First, install `drat`:

```{r drat, eval = FALSE}
if (!require("drat")) {
    install.packages("drat")
    library("drat")
}
```

Then use `drat` to tell R about the repository where `covdata` is hosted:

```{r drat-covdata}
drat::addRepo("kjhealy")
```

You can now install `covdata`:

```{r covdata-drat, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("covdata")
```

To ensure that the `covdata` repository is always available, you can add the following line to your `.Rprofile` or `.Rprofile.site` file:

```{r rprofile}
drat::addRepo("kjhealy")
```

With that in place you'll be able to do `install.packages("covdata")` or `update.packages("covdata")` and have everything work as you'd expect. 

Note that my drat repository only contains data packages that are not on CRAN, so you will never be in danger of grabbing the wrong version of any other package.

## Loading the Data

### US CDC Surveillance Network Data
This US Centers for Disase Control surveillance network conducts population-based surveillance for laboratory-confirmed COVID-19-associated hospitalizations in children (persons younger than 18 years) and adults in the United States. The current network covers nearly 100 counties in the 10 Emerging Infections Program (EIP) states (CA, CO, CT, GA, MD, MN, NM, NY, OR, and TN) and four additional states through the Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Project (IA, MI, OH, and UT). The network represents approximately 10% of US population (~32 million people).  Cases are identified by reviewing hospital, laboratory, and admission databases and infection control logs for
patients hospitalized with a documented positive SARS-CoV-2 test. Data gathered are used to estimate
age-specific hospitalization rates on a weekly basis and describe characteristics of persons
hospitalized with COVID-19. Laboratory confirmation is dependent on clinician-ordered SARS-CoV-2
testing. Therefore, the unadjusted rates provided are likely to be underestimated as
COVID-19-associated hospitalizations can be missed due to test availability and provider or facility
testing practices.  COVID-NET hospitalization data are preliminary and subject to change as more data
become available. All incidence rates are unadjusted. Please use the following citation when
referencing these data: “COVID-NET: COVID-19-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network, Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention. WEBSITE. Accessed on DATE”.

Thanks to Bob Rudis's [`cdccovidview`](https://github.com/hrbrmstr/cdccovidview) package for making these data tractable to include.
