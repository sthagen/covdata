`covdata` is a data package for R. It provides COVID-19 related data from the following sources: 

- National level case and mortality data from the [European Centers for Disease Control](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en).  
- State-level case and mortality data for the United States from the [COVID Tracking Project](https://covidtracking.com). 
- State-level and county-level case and mortality data for the United States from the [_New York Times_](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data).
- Data from the US Centers for Disease Control's [Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/index.html) (COVID-NET). See below for details about this network and the scope of its coverage.
- Data from [Apple](http://apple.com/covid19) on relative trends in mobility in cities and countries since mid-January of 2020, based on usage of their Maps application.
- Data from [Google](https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/data_documentation.html) on relative trends in mobility in regions and countries since mid-January of 2020, based on location and activity information.

The data are provided as-is. More information about collection methods, scope, limits, and possible sources of error in the data can be found in the documentation provided by their respective sources. (Follow the links above.)

Data are current through `r format(Sys.Date(), "%A, %B %e, %Y")`.

## Installation

There are two ways to install the `covdata` package. 

### Install direct from GitHub

You can install the beta version of congress from [GitHub](https://github.com/kjhealy/congress) with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("kjhealy/covdata")
```

### Installation using `drat`

While using `install_github()` works just fine, it would be nicer to be able to just type `install.packages("covdata")` or `update.packages("covdata")` in the ordinary way. We can do this using Dirk Eddelbuettel's [drat](http://eddelbuettel.github.io/drat/DratForPackageUsers.html) package. Drat provides a convenient way to make R aware of package repositories other than CRAN.

First, install `drat`:

```{r drat, eval = FALSE}
if (!require("drat")) {
    install.packages("drat")
    library("drat")
}
```

Then use `drat` to tell R about the repository where `covdata` is hosted:

```{r drat-covdata}
drat::addRepo("kjhealy")
```

You can now install `covdata`:

```{r covdata-drat, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("covdata")
```

To ensure that the `covdata` repository is always available, you can add the following line to your `.Rprofile` or `.Rprofile.site` file:

```{r rprofile}
drat::addRepo("kjhealy")
```

With that in place you'll be able to do `install.packages("covdata")` or `update.packages("covdata")` and have everything work as you'd expect. 

Note that my drat repository only contains data packages that are not on CRAN, so you will never be in danger of grabbing the wrong version of any other package.

### US CDC Surveillance Network Data
This US Centers for Disase Control surveillance network conducts population-based surveillance for laboratory-confirmed COVID-19-associated hospitalizations in children (persons younger than 18 years) and adults in the United States. The current network covers nearly 100 counties in the 10 Emerging Infections Program (EIP) states (CA, CO, CT, GA, MD, MN, NM, NY, OR, and TN) and four additional states through the Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Project (IA, MI, OH, and UT). The network represents approximately 10% of US population (~32 million people).  Cases are identified by reviewing hospital, laboratory, and admission databases and infection control logs for
patients hospitalized with a documented positive SARS-CoV-2 test. Data gathered are used to estimate
age-specific hospitalization rates on a weekly basis and describe characteristics of persons
hospitalized with COVID-19. Laboratory confirmation is dependent on clinician-ordered SARS-CoV-2
testing. Therefore, the unadjusted rates provided are likely to be underestimated as
COVID-19-associated hospitalizations can be missed due to test availability and provider or facility
testing practices.  COVID-NET hospitalization data are preliminary and subject to change as more data
become available. All incidence rates are unadjusted. Please use the following citation when
referencing these data: “COVID-NET: COVID-19-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network, Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention. WEBSITE. Accessed on DATE”.

### Apple Mobility Data
Apple has made aggregated data available on relative trends in use of its Maps data across a range of cities, regions, and countries. Data show relative volume of directions requests per country/region or city compared to a baseline volume on January 13th, 2020. Apple defines the day as midnight-to-midnight, Pacific time. Cities represent usage in greater metropolitan areas and are stably defined during this period. In many countries/regions and cities, relative volume has increased since January 13th, consistent with normal, seasonal usage of Apple Maps. Day of week effects are important to normalize as you use this data. Data that is sent from users’ devices to the Apple Maps service is associated with random, rotating identifiers so Apple does not have a profile of individual movements and searches. Apple Maps has no demographic information about its users, and so cannot make any statements about the representativeness of its usage against the overall population.

```{r apple-example, fig.height=20, fig.width=10, dpi=300}
vec_brks <- c(-50, 0, 50)
vec_labs <- vec_brks + 100

apple_mobility %>% 
  filter(geo_type == "city", transportation_type == "driving") %>%
  mutate(over_under = index < 100, 
         index = index - 100) %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = date, y = index, 
                       group = region, color = over_under)) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = "gray40") + 
  geom_col() + 
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = vec_brks, labels = vec_labs) + 
  scale_color_manual(values = c("firebrick", "steelblue")) +
  facet_wrap(~ region, ncol = 8) + 
  guides(color = FALSE) + 
  labs(x = "Date", y = "Relative Mobility", title = "Relative Trends in Apple Maps Usage for Driving, Selected Cities", 
                              subtitle = "Data are indexed to 100 for each city's usage on January 13th 2020",

### Google Mobility Reports
These Community Mobility Reports aim to provide insights into what has changed in response to policies aimed at combating COVID-19. The reports chart movement trends over time by geography, across different categories of places such as retail and recreation, groceries and pharmacies, parks, transit stations, workplaces, and residential. Each Community Mobility Report dataset is presented by location and highlights the percent change in visits to places like grocery stores and parks within a geographic area. These datasets show how visits and length of stay at different places change compared to a baseline. Changes for each day are compared to a baseline value for that day of the week:

- The baseline is the median value, for the corresponding day of the week, during the 5-week period Jan 3–Feb 6, 2020.
- The datasets show trends over several months.
- What data is included in the calculation depends on user settings, connectivity, and whether it meets Google's privacy threshold. If the privacy threshold isn’t met (when somewhere isn’t busy enough to ensure anonymity) no change is shown for the day. 

```{r google-example, fig.height=12, fig.width=10, dpi=300}
google_mobility %>% 
  filter(country_region_code == "US", !is.na(sub_region_1), is.na(sub_region_2)) %>%
  mutate(type = tools::toTitleCase(type)) %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = date, y = pct_diff, 
                       group = sub_region_1)) + 
  geom_line(size = 0.5, color = "gray80") + 
  geom_smooth(aes(color = type, group = 1), se = FALSE) + 
  facet_wrap(~ type, ncol = 2) + 
  labs(x = "Date", y = "Percent Change from Baseline", title = "Relative Trends in Mobility for Kinds of Location in the US, by State", 
                              subtitle = "Data are relative to median activity between Jan 3rd and Feb 6th",
       color = "Location Type", 
       caption = "Data: Google. Graph: @kjhealy") + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  theme(legend.position = "top", 
        strip.text = element_text(size = rel(1.3)))
